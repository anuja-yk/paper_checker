# Paper Checker

Accepting and scoring user responses for questions by comparing with model answers.

## Introduction
- PaperChecker is a web application that corrects answers given to questions by comparing them with model answers. Since checking exam sheets is a time consuming and tedious task, this web app will assist teachers in doing so.
- The questions and their respective model answers will be stored in a csv (comma separated values)  file, using which the code will compare the model answers and userâ€™s answers and finally, at the end, showing the total score obtained by the user in table format.
